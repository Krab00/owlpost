# e2e-watch-route.sh — proof on the real Claude Code harness that exactly one session wakes
# per record (OWL-033, design §8, §12): two idle sessions in two directories, one of them the
# configured checkout of the test project; `owl route <id>` writes the record's framed block
# into that session's private wake directory ($OWLPOST_HOME/sessions/<session_id>/wake, the
# SessionStart hook registered it as a watch path) and only that session's FileChanged hook
# (asyncRewake) exits 2 and gets a new model turn — the other session stays silent.
#
#   scripts/e2e-watch-route.sh                      # installed plugin, the `owl` on PATH
#   E2E_PLUGIN_DIR=plugins/claude-code PATH=$PWD/target/release:$PATH scripts/e2e-watch-route.sh
#
#   E2E_PLUGIN_DIR   plugin directory to load with `--plugin-dir` (default: none — the plugin
#                    installed at user scope is what runs)
#   E2E_OUT          directory that keeps both stream files as evidence (default: a temp dir,
#                    printed at the end)
#
# Two `claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --verbose
# --include-hook-events --permission-mode bypassPermissions` sessions run in one throwaway
# OWLPOST_HOME with their stdin held open (a FIFO each): session A in $WORK/a, which
# config.json maps as the checkout of the test project github.com/e2e/repo, session B in
# $WORK/b. The script sends each exactly one user message (`Reply with exactly the word:
# ready`), waits for both first `"type":"result"` events, drops one unseen question record
# about github.com/e2e/repo into $OWLPOST_HOME/spool/inbox/ and runs `owl route <id>`. Within
# 60 s stream A must carry a `system` `hook_response` event with `"hook_event":"FileChanged"`,
# `"exit_code":2` and the 🦉 framed block (the question text verbatim), followed by a second
# `"type":"assistant"` event; stream B must carry no FileChanged hook_response and no second
# assistant event, checked 10 s after A woke. No second user message is ever sent. Prints
# `PASS` or `FAIL <reason>`, exits non-zero on FAIL (2 = precondition); each `claude` run is
# bounded by `timeout 180`. Cost: two `claude -p` calls.
