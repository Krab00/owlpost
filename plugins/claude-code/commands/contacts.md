No arguments. This command only lists; a contact is asked by mentioning it in the prompt.

1. Run `owl contact list --json`. It prints a JSON array with one object per contact of the
   merged book (global `$OWLPOST_HOME/contacts/` plus this repository's `.agents/peers/`):
   `name`, `fingerprint`, `source` (`global` or `local`), `emails`, `endpoints` and, only
   when a policy is set, `policy` with `mode` (`manual`, `auto` or `never`).
   If the array is empty, print one line: "No contacts yet — run /owlpost:add with a colleague's peer file." and stop.
2. Print the book as ONE table, sorted by name, with the columns name, e-mails, fingerprint,
   source and policy; a contact without `policy` shows `-` in the policy column.
3. End with exactly this hint, on one line:
   Type @owl: and the start of the name, pick the contact, then type the question.
   The picked contact is inserted as a mention of the shape `@owl:to://<name-slug>.<email>`
   (the `owl` MCP server's resource URI, for example `@owl:to://ana-kowalska.ana@acme.pl`).
