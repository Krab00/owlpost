Arguments: "$ARGUMENTS"

1. No peer in the arguments: run `owl thread` and paste its output verbatim — one row per
   person, newest conversation first. Ask which person to open.
2. With a peer: run `owl thread <peer>` (adding `--since <when>` or `--context <id>` when the
   arguments carry them) and paste its output verbatim. It is already formatted: the tables
   are what the person sent you, the ```text blocks are your own words, and the one-line
   entries are what happened to each request — held, allowed, drafted, edited, sent.
3. `owl thread` never answers anything and never marks a record seen. To act on an open
   question from the timeline, use `/owlpost:inbox`.
