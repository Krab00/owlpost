# owlpost

owlpost lets you ask a colleague's coding agent a question about their code. You send the
question from your terminal or from Claude Code; it lands on your colleague's machine, their own
agent reads their checkout and drafts an answer, and **they approve it before it comes back to
you**. The machines talk directly to each other over mutual TLS — there is no central server,
no shared memory and no account to create.

Status: pre-alpha, private. Rust, single static binary `owl`.

## How to use it

Every step has a terminal command (`owl …`) and, where it exists, a Claude Code slash command
(`/owlpost:…`). They do the same thing; the slash command runs it for you inside the session.

### 1. Install

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Krab00/owlpost/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Downloads a release of `owl`, verifies its SHA-256 and installs it to `~/.local/bin`
(`--version <tag>`, `--prefix <dir>`, `--system` for `/usr/local/bin`). macOS and Linux,
x86_64 and aarch64.

Then one command does the rest — create your key, register the background service, install the
Claude Code plugin:

```
owl setup --name "Your Name" --email you@company.com
```

Plugin first works too: install the plugin in Claude Code and let it fetch the binary.

```
/plugin marketplace add Krab00/owlpost
/plugin install owlpost@owlpost-local
/owlpost:setup --name "Your Name" --email you@company.com
```

Check everything:

```
owl doctor          # /owlpost:doctor
```

One line per check (key, config, endpoints, harnesses, daemon). All green means you can receive
questions. `owl update` replaces the binary and the plugin later on.

Optional: owlpost also runs as a **Claude Code mod**. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1`
and restart Claude Code. You get an inbox band above the prompt and a pane
(`/owlpost:contacts`, `/owlpost:inbox`, or `/owlpost:ask` with no arguments) for browsing
contacts, asking and answering without spending model tokens. Run the same command again to
close the pane. See
[the plugin README](plugins/claude-code/README.md#claude-code-mods).

### 2. Exchange identities

You and your colleague swap a small JSON "peer file" (name, e-mail, public key, endpoints).

```
owl contact export          # /owlpost:me      — your own peer file, send it to them
owl add bartek.json         # /owlpost:add     — add theirs (a path, the JSON itself, or -)
owl contact list            # /owlpost:contacts
owl whoami                  # /owlpost:whoami  — your fingerprint
```

Adding a contact sets no permission. Compare the fingerprint (`owl:` + 16 characters) with them
by call or chat before you allow them.

In a repository you can also commit peer files to `.agents/peers/` (`owl add --local`) so the
whole team shares one contact list.

### 3. Decide who may ask you

```
owl allow bartek            # /owlpost:allow bartek   — release his held questions, you approve each answer
owl allow bartek --once     # release what is held, no permanent policy
owl allow bartek --always   # answer his questions automatically (see Security)
owl deny bartek             # /owlpost:deny bartek    — refuse; new questions get a 403
```

The first question from an unknown peer is held until you allow or deny.

### 4. Ask

```
owl ask bartek src/auth/session.rs "why is the refresh token rotated on every read?"
/owlpost:ask bartek src/auth/session.rs why is the refresh token rotated on every read?
```

The path is optional; without it the question is about the whole repository. Useful flags:

- `--wait 120` — block and print each state change until the answer arrives.
- `--reply-to <id>` — continue an earlier exchange, so their agent sees the thread.
- `--context <file>` — attach a diff, an error or an excerpt (max 8192 bytes; `-` reads stdin).
- `--file <path>` — propose peers from `git blame` of that file.

While you wait:

```
owl status                  # /owlpost:status  — where each open question stands
```

States are in the owner's words: *waiting for the owner's consent*, *the owner's agent is
answering*, *the owner is reviewing the answer*.

### 5. Answer someone

```
owl inbox                   # /owlpost:inbox — table of ID, FROM, TYPE, STATE, PATH, AGE
owl show <id>               # /owlpost:show  — the full question
owl draft <id>              # /owlpost:draft — your agent answers read-only from this checkout
owl edit <id>               # /owlpost:edit  — open the draft in $EDITOR (terminal only)
owl send <id>               # /owlpost:send  — sign it and put it in the outbox
owl reject <id>             # /owlpost:reject — discard it, the peer gets no answer
```

`/owlpost:inbox` walks the whole loop for you: it shows each question, handles consent, and
offers send / edit / reject. `/owlpost:reply "<your text>"` answers the question last shown
in the session in your own words instead of using the agent's draft.

Nothing leaves your machine until you run `send`.

### 6. Look things up later

```
owl history                        # /owlpost:history
owl history --peer bartek
owl history --path "src/auth/*.rs"
owl history --since 3d
```

## How it works

A small background service (`owl daemon`, registered with launchd or systemd by `owl install`)
listens on your machine and keeps a file spool: an inbox for what arrives, an outbox for what
leaves. Questions go out immediately over mutual TLS; answers are pulled back later, so both
people never have to be online at the same time.

```
  you                              your colleague's machine
  ---                              ------------------------
  owl ask  --mTLS-->  daemon  -->  inbox (held until consent)
                                     |  owl allow / /owlpost:inbox
                                     v
                                   read-only headless agent
                                   reads the repo checkout
                                     |
                                     v
                                   draft  ->  owner reviews  ->  owl send
                                                                   |
  owl inbox  <-------  daemon pulls the signed answer  <------------+
```

The daemon never runs a model on arrival in manual mode — it is a mailbox with a signature
check. Only `owl draft` (or an auto-accepted peer) starts the answering agent. No central
server is involved; the two machines talk to each other directly.

## What people use it for

- **Onboarding to a teammate's module.** "What is the entry point of the billing service, and
  which parts am I allowed to call directly?" — instead of a 30-minute call.
- **Understanding a PR you have to review.** Attach the diff:
  `owl ask maciek --context pr.diff "is this the right place to invalidate the cache?"`
- **Operational facts nobody wrote down.** `owl ask ola "which branch do you deploy to prod from?"`
- **An error you cannot place.** `owl ask bartek --context error.log "our client gets 409 from
  your API on retries — is that expected?"`
- **Cross-team API questions.** Ask the owning team's agent about their contract instead of
  guessing from their OpenAPI file.
- **A follow-up on an earlier answer.** `owl ask bartek --reply-to <id> "and what about the
  mobile client?"` keeps the thread, so their agent sees the earlier exchange.

Answers land in your inbox and, through the Claude Code plugin, in your agent's memory — so the
same question does not have to be asked twice. `owl history` is worth a look before you ask.

## Security

- **Identity is a key, not an account.** `owl init` creates an ed25519 keypair. Your fingerprint
  is `owl:` plus 16 characters of the hash of your public key; you compare it with your colleague
  out of band before trusting them.
- **Mutual TLS between machines.** TLS 1.3 with self-signed certificates generated from that
  key; each side compares the certificate's public key with the one pinned in its contact list.
  An unknown key is refused at the handshake. Every message body is also ed25519-signed.
- **Consent per person.** Policy is `manual` (default after `owl allow` — you approve each
  answer), `auto` (`--always`, answers go out without asking; a hand-added contact additionally
  needs `--i-verified-the-fingerprint`), or `never` (`owl deny` — new questions get 403, worded
  the same as being offline).
- **The answering agent is read-only.** It runs headless in a separate session with read tools
  only — no shell, no write tools, no network. The worst outcome of a malicious question is a
  bad answer.
- **A human approves before anything leaves.** In manual mode the draft is stored and shown to
  you; it is sent only by `owl send`. In auto mode redaction regexes run over the draft and
  every outgoing answer is logged.
- **What a peer can see.** Only what their question's answer contains, drawn from your repo
  checkout and project-level files (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`). Your private memory directory is
  opt-in; session transcripts are out of scope. A peer never gets shell access, file listings or
  anything you did not approve.
- **Limits.** `--context` attachments are capped at 8192 bytes. Each peer has a rate limit
  (default 20 questions/hour, then `429`). Replayed or stale messages (more than 5 minutes off)
  are rejected. Incoming text is treated as data, never as instructions.
